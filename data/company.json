Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior.This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East - gate of Moria.At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet 'Oakenshield', which would remain with him even in death. Thorin eventually became King - in -Exile of Durin 's Folk after his father went missing, and died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.",

        "description": "Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug. Fíli and Kíli were the two most active dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly Bombur, they appeared more frequently as 'individual' characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in 'group' references to the entire company. Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company. As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains. With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river. At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain. Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and all three were buried with honor.",

He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.",

He was wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, his tucked into the belt and walked in as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli and Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself.[1] Dwalin lent a green hood and cloak to Bilbo when they set out on their journey. After Thorin's Company reclaimed the mountain from Smaug, Dwalin fought alongside his companions in the Battle of Five Armies. He survived the battle, and later received his fourteenth share of Smaug's hoard. He chose to live afterwards in Erebor under the rule of Dáin II Ironfoot, Thorin's cousin and now King under the Mountain.",

Though it saw initial success, the colony was destroyed in TA 2994 when the Balrog (Durin's Bane) and Orcs began to press back from the initial fight. After Balin died, Ori and others lived just long enough to bury him properly in a stone tomb before dying themselves in the last stand in the Chamber of Mazarbul. Ori recalls his last moments in The Book of Mazarbul which Gandalf reads from when the Fellowship passes by Balin's Tomb some twenty-four years later. His body is left clutching the scarred, bloodied, and shredded book; a warrior-scribe to the last breath.",

Bilbo shortly thereafter saved Dori by grabbing his legs as they were rescued by the Great Eagles and taken to their eyrie from the Misty Mountains.

Afterwards he remained in the Kingdom under the Mountain, and Glóin reported that he was still there seventy-seven years later, at the time of the War of the Ring.",

While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the meeting at Bag End with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. He accompanied Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and rest of Thorin's Company across Wilderland to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug.

Bombur tumbled with Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they first entered Bag End. He chose to stay and guard the camp and supplies while the others moved up the Lonely Mountain, because he trusted neither mountain paths nor ropes to stay intact under his weight. However, he was later forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon Smaug before he could be slain.",
